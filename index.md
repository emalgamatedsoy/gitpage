# Welcome
Hello everyone! Welcome to my website.
![Octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)
I have been a github user for quite some time, and have written several programs in a variety of runtimes.
This website is designed using github pages, with the "jekyll-theme-hacker" theme applied.



I'm an avid linux user, and enjoy focusing on the middleware and back-end configuration for applications.
My current professional work is focused on working with cloud foundry and kubernetes techologies.
My interests include distributed systems and cyber security.
Please check out my github in the link below for access to my public projects.
