# Welcome
Hello everyone! Welcome to my website.
![Octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)
I have been a github user for quite some time, and have written several programs in a variety of runtimes.
This website is designed using github pages, with the "jekyll-theme-hacker" theme applied.



I'm an avid linux user, and enjoy the entire stack for applications.
My professional work is focused on working with cloud foundry and kubernetes techologies.
Please check out my github here for more information and varieties of applications that I have written.
