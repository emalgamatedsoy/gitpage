My experience in software enigneering stems began writing C++ in community college, working on game design and engineering.
Currently I am engineering cloud foundry and kubernetes systems for an insurance company in new england.
I am an avid reader of cybersecurity, medicine, psychology and computer science and love to write software.
As a self-proclaimed computer scientest, I have been fascinated by distributed systems, but enjoy reading about embedded systems, peer-to-peer techonolgies such as blockchains, as well as machine learning and AI.
