My experience in software enigneering stems began writing C++ in community college, to engineering cloud foundry and kubernetes systems.
I'm a quick learner and love to hear about new and up-and-coming software engineering topics.
As a computer scientest, I have been fascinated by distributed systems, but enjoy reading about embedded systems, peer-to-peer techonolgies like blockchain,
as well as machine learning and AI.
